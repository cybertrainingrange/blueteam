# ACCESS CONTROL in AWS is the process of defining and managing permissions for users, groups, and roles to access AWS resources and services. It’s a fundamental aspect of securing AWS resources and ensuring that only authorized users have access to them. You can use policies to control what the person making the request is allowed to do. To do this, you must attach an identity-based policy to that person’s identity (user, user group, or role). You can also use a permissions boundary to set the maximum permissions that an entity (user or role) can have. The goal of access control is to minimize the security risk of unauthorized access to physical and logical systems. 

Identity and Access Management (IAM) ensures that the right people and job roles in your organization can access the tools they need to do their jobs. AWS IAM is a web service that helps you control access to AWS resources. You can use it to manage users and their access to AWS resources, such as EC2 (virtual machine that represents a physical server for you to deploy your application) instances, S3 buckets (a public cloud storage resource available in AWS), and RDS (Remote Desktop Services) instances. With IAM, you can create users, groups, and roles, and then assign permissions to them based on policies that you define. These policies can be used to control access to specific resources or to allow users to perform specific actions on those resources. With IAM, you can centrally manage permissions that control which AWS resources users can access. You use IAM to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources. 
Authentication: the process of defining an identity and the verification of that identity. An example would be a username and password.
Authorization: determines what an identity can access within a system once it’s been authenticated to it.

Least privilege access, in AWS, refers to the practice of granting only the minimum level of permissions necessary for a user, group, or application to perform their required tasks. This ensures that access is restricted to only the resources and actions that are essential for the user to perform their job, which reduces the risk of accidental or intentional damage to the system. With IAM policies, you can specify exactly what actions a user can perform on each resource, as well as the conditions under which those actions are allowed. By following the principle of least privilege access in AWS, you can help to prevent unauthorized access to your resources, minimize the risk of data breaches, and improve the overall security of your AWS environment.
