What is a firewall ?

A firewall is like a virtual security guard that helps keep your computer and network safe from bad guys.
It works by creating a wall between your computer and the internet. This wall checks all the data that comes in and out of your computer, making sure it's safe and not harmful. If the wall sees something that looks bad, it will block it from entering or leaving your computer.

Purpose of a firewall? 

The purpose of a firewall is to protect your computer and the information on it from unauthorized access and malicious software. This means that it can stop hackers, viruses, malware, and other bad things from getting into your computer and causing damage or stealing your personal information.

Why do you need a firewall? 

Crucial component of any organization's cybersecurity infrastructure. Acts as the first line of defense against external threats such as hackers, malware, and other cyber-attacks. By monitoring and filtering incoming and outgoing network traffic, a firewall can prevent unauthorized access to your network and keep sensitive information secure.
In addition, a firewall can also help you control and manage network access for your employees, guests, and other devices. For instance, you can set up rules and policies that restrict access to certain websites or block specific types of traffic. This can help prevent employees from accidentally or intentionally accessing harmful websites or applications that can put your organization at risk.
A firewall can also provide you with valuable insights into your network traffic and activity. By monitoring network traffic and generating logs, you can identify potential threats, track network usage patterns, and troubleshoot network issues.
Overall, a firewall is an essential tool for any organization that wants to safeguard its network, data, and reputation from cyber threats. It can help you maintain compliance with industry standards and regulations, protect your customers' sensitive information, and prevent costly security breaches.

OPNsense is an open source, easy-to-use and easy-to-build FreeBSD based firewall and routing platform. OPNsense includes most of the features available in expensive commercial firewalls, and more in many cases. It brings the rich feature set of commercial offerings with the benefits of open and verifiable sources.

IPFire employs a Stateful Packet Inspection (SPI) firewall, which is built on top of Netfilter, the Linux packet filtering framework. It filters packets fast and achieves throughputs of up to multiple tens of Gigabit per second.
Its intuitive web user interface allows to create groups of hosts and networks which can be used to keep large set of rules short and tidy - something very important in complex environments with strict access control. Logging and graphical reports give great insight.
Various settings are available to mitigate and block Denial-of-Service attacks by filtering them directly at the firewall and not allowing them to take down your servers.
